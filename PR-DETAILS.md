- Immunizations, Mental Health, Genetic Data
- Insurance, Emergency Contacts

**Access Levels**:
- **READ** (0): View-only access to records
- **WRITE** (1): Create and modify records
- **ADMIN** (2): Full administrative control
- **EMERGENCY** (3): Emergency override access

**Core Functions**:
- `create-record`: Store new encrypted medical record
- `get-record`: Retrieve record with access logging
- `update-record`: Modify existing record with versioning
- `grant-provider-access`: Authorize provider permissions
- `revoke-provider-access`: Remove provider access
- `archive-record`: Archive records for retention compliance

**Security Architecture**:
- End-to-end encryption with key management
- Digital signatures for data integrity
- Checksum verification for data corruption detection
- Access permission validation before all operations
- Emergency override capabilities with audit trails

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Consent and record management are separate contracts for modularity and security
2. **Privacy by Design**: Patient consent is required before any data access
3. **Audit-First Approach**: Every action is logged for regulatory compliance
4. **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained access control at data type level
5. **Emergency Protocols**: Built-in emergency override for life-threatening situations

### Data Structures

**Patient Profiles**:
```clarity
{
  patient-id: (string-ascii 64),
  date-of-birth: uint,
  emergency-contact: (optional principal),
  primary-physician: (optional principal),
  deceased: bool,
  registration-date: uint,
  last-updated: uint
}
```

**Medical Records**:
```clarity
{
  record-type: uint,
  created-by: principal,
  created-at: uint,
  status: uint,
  title: (string-ascii 100),
  data-hash: (string-ascii 64),
  encryption-key-id: (optional (string-ascii 64)),
  confidentiality-level: uint
}
```

**Access Permissions**:
```clarity
{
  access-level: uint,
  granted-by: principal,
  granted-at: uint,
  expires-at: (optional uint),
  audit-required: bool
}
```

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error codes for all failure scenarios:
- Patient/Provider/Record not found
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Invalid data types or signatures
- Emergency access violations
- Retention period violations
- Duplicate record prevention

### Integration Points

**Consent Integration**: The record management contract validates permissions through the consent contract before allowing access.

**External Systems**: Designed to integrate with:
- Healthcare Information Systems (HIS)
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Identity providers for healthcare workers
- Encryption key management systems
- Audit and compliance monitoring tools

## Compliance Features

### HIPAA Compliance

1. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with minimum necessary access
2. **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications
3. **Data Integrity**: Checksums and digital signatures
4. **Transmission Security**: Encrypted data storage and transmission
5. **Person Authentication**: Principal-based identity verification

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All medical data stored encrypted
- **Access Logging**: Every access attempt logged with timestamp
- **Consent Verification**: Access only with explicit patient consent
- **Emergency Protocols**: Override procedures for life-threatening situations
- **Data Minimization**: Granular consent for specific data types only

## Business Logic

### Patient Journey

1. **Registration**: Patient creates profile with basic information
2. **Consent Granting**: Patient authorizes specific providers for specific data types
3. **Record Creation**: Healthcare providers create encrypted medical records
4. **Data Access**: Providers access records based on consent and permissions
5. **Consent Management**: Patients can modify or revoke consent at any time
6. **Emergency Situations**: Emergency override provides immediate access when needed

### Provider Workflow

1. **Permission Request**: Request access to specific patient data types
2. **Record Management**: Create, update, and archive medical records
3. **Compliance Monitoring**: All actions logged for audit purposes
4. **Emergency Access**: Emergency override procedures for critical care
